Verilog with FPGA. This is a project that I made for my class final. It is a game made using Nexys Artyx A7 FPGA learners board. The FPGA was coded on Vivado 2020.2 using verilog. The game that I created is a recreation of the popular retro game called Breakout, by Atari 1976. The game is played using the on board buttons as the game controller.
